03/24/25 Compiles and works on a fresh vagrant box with setup.sh and ./make_build..
with the following cores/libs.  Also works after upgrading LovyanGFX to 1.2.0

	vagrant@vagrant:~$ arduino-cli core list; arduino-cli lib list

Compiling and uploading with arduino-cli:
arduino-cli compile -b esp32:esp32:esp32s3:PartitionScheme=huge_app,PSRAM=opi --port /dev/ttyUSB0 -v -u
needs esp32 board versions < 3.0 

needs specific versions of arduino libraries: 
	ESP32_Display_Panel v0.0.2
	lvgl 8.3.11
	
3/27/24 Notes on square ESP32-S3-LCD-4.3 square touch LCD.  Apparently had been working on ~/Arduino/libraries/ESP32_Display_Panel/examples/LVGL/Porting in arduno IDE.  

Docs: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3, follow arduino setup - synopsis: install direct arudino 2 from arduino website, download DS3-4.3-libraries.zip and install over ~/Arduino/libraries, install espressif esp32 in board managers
Sometimes the Arduino IDE build fails, panic: runtime error: index out of range [5] with length 5 or some such.  Seems to help to restart the IDE
Board settings: ESP32-S3 DEV Module,  8MB flash, 8MB partition, OPSI PSRAM
TFT_eSPI library seems to not be configured for touch - 
These solved by using different version of sketch
Troubleshooting touch i2c errors
E (2031) lcd_panel.io.i2c: panel_io_i2c_rx_buffer(128): i2c transaction failed
E (2031) GT911: touch_gt911_read_cfg(262): GT911 read error!
E (2032) GT911: esp_lcd_touch_new_i2c_gt911(122): GT911 init failed
Abandoning this for now, may be a flakey board 

Installed libraries from https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T-RGB, this overwrites the .zip file lvgl library from WaveShare.   Had to symlink lvgl/{examples,demos} into lvgl/src/
